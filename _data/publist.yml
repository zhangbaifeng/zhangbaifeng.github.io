  image: splitfusion.png
  description: "A companion data analysis platform named SplitFusion, to detect gene fusion based on split alignments, such as reads crossing fusion breakpoints, with the ability to accurately infer in-frame or out-of-frame of fusion partners of a given fusion candidate. SplitFusion also outputs example breakpoint-supporting sequences in FASTA format, allowing for further investigations. SplitFusion can economically and effectively distinguish true oncogenic fusions from environment noise, amplification or sequencing errors, especially for low quality input of clinical samples."
